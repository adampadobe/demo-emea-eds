# Nav document content reference (copy into da.live)

Update your **nav** document in Document Authoring with the structure below. The header block expects **three areas** in order: **brand**, **sections**, **tools**.

---

## 1. Brand (first area)

One link for the site name or logo, pointing to home.

| Link text (e.g. your site name) | URL |
|----------------------------------|-----|
| Boilerplate (or "Demo EMEA")     | `/` |

Use your actual site name and keep the link to `/`.

---

## 2. Sections (second area) – main sidebar links

Add **one link per row**. Use the **exact** label in the first column so the sidebar shows the correct icon.

| Label           | URL             |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Book            | `/book`         |
| Manage          | `/manage`       |
| Check-in        | `/check-in`     |
| Flight status   | `/flight-status`|
| Plan            | `/plan`         |
| Offers          | `/offers`       |
| Loyalty         | `/loyalty`      |
| Help            | `/help`         |

**Important:** Use **Flight status** (two words) so the clock icon appears. Other labels must match exactly for icons (Book, Manage, Check-in, Plan, Offers, Loyalty, Help).

---

## 3. Tools (third area, optional)

Optional links for the bottom of the sidebar (e.g. region, search, login). You can leave this empty or add links as needed.

Example:

| Link text | URL    |
|-----------|--------|
| Region    | `/`    |
| Sign in   | `/help`|

---

## In da.live

1. Open your project → open the **nav** document.
2. Ensure there are **three sections** (brand, sections, tools).
3. In **sections**, add the eight rows from the table above: label in the link text, URL in the link href.
4. Save and **Publish**.

After publishing, the sidebar will show all eight items with the right icons and links to the published pages.
